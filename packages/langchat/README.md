## üöÄ Getting Started

### What You Need
- A business mobile app project
- Basic app development knowledge
- An AI workflow system (we'll help you set this up)

### Prerequisites
- React Native/Expo development environment
- iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, or physical device
- Basic app development knowledge
- An AI workflow system (we'll help you set this up)

**Important:** For swipe gesture functionality, ensure `react-native-gesture-handler` is properly installed and configured:

```bash
npm install react-native-gesture-handler
```

**Note:** The `GestureHandlerRootView` is automatically included within the ChatScreen component, so you don't need to wrap your app with it manually. The package handles gesture setup internally.

For React Native CLI projects, follow the [installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation) for platform-specific setup.

### Quick Setup
1. **Download and install**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start building**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Connect your business logic**

**How to Enable Message Management:**
```jsx
<ChatScreen
  showMessageActions={true} // Enable message deletion features

/

// Or use MessageList directly
<MessageList
  messages={messages}
  showMessageActions={true}
  onDeleteMessage={(messageId) => console.log('Delete:', messageId)}
